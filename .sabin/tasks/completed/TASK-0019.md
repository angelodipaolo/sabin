# Requirements

Redesign what is displayed when the new ticket button is clicked. 

**Form Fields:**
- Title field (required) - marked with red asterisk
- Description textarea (optional) - clearly labeled as optional
- Auto-focus on title field when dialog opens

**Interaction:**
- Create button is disabled until a title is entered
- Cancel button to dismiss
- X button in header to close
- Clean VS Code-style dark theme with proper focus states

The dialog follows standard VS Code extension patterns with appropriate spacing, focus indicators, and a clear visual hierarchy. The "Create Ticket" button provides clear feedback when disabled (grayed out) versus enabled state.
