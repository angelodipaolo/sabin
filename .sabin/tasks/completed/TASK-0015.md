title: Remove 'Sabin Tickets' header text and convert New Ticket button to icon
description: >-
  Improve webview UI by removing redundant header text and using icon-only
  button
---
## Requirements

### User Experience Improvements
- Remove the 'Sabin Tickets' text from the webview header (line 329 in webviewProvider.ts) to reduce visual clutter
- The text is redundant since the panel/view already has a title shown by VS Code
- Replace the text-based 'New Ticket' button with an icon-only button for a cleaner, more professional look
- Use the VS Code Codicon 'add' icon (plus sign) for the new ticket button
- Include a tooltip on the icon button to maintain accessibility and discoverability

### Functional Requirements
- Button must retain all current functionality (triggers 'showCreateTicketDialog' command)
- Button styling should use 'icon-button' class instead of 'btn-primary' for proper icon button appearance
- Tooltip should read 'Create new ticket' for clarity

### UI/UX Considerations
- Icon button should be properly sized and aligned within the header
- Button should maintain hover states and visual feedback
- The header layout should remain clean and well-organized after removing the text
- Ensure adequate spacing and padding around the icon button

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Button click events must work identically to current implementation
- No changes to underlying command execution or message passing
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing event handlers

### Technical Implementation
- Update HTML template in webviewProvider.ts getHtmlForWebview() method around line 328-331
- Remove h2 element containing 'Sabin Tickets' text
- Update button element to use Codicon syntax: <button class="icon-button" title="Create new ticket"></button>
- Update CSS in media/main.css if needed to properly style icon buttons
