title: rebrand ticket to be "task"
---

Keep the concept of "ticket" but rename it to be "task". We should rename all references to "tickets", in the vs code extension, the CLI, the prompts. all code files, tests, all UI labels.

All functionality should remain the same. It's just a rename from ticket to task
