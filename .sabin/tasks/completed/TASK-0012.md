  VS Code extension: Fix ticket board reactivity when files move between
  directories
description: >-
  Currently TICKET-0010 shows as 'open' in the board view even though it's in
  the resolved directory with status 'resolved'. Implement: 1) Consolidate file
  operations into a shared service for both TreeView and Webview, 2) Enhance
  file watcher to explicitly handle rename events and improve directory
  watching, 3) Add timing/debounce improvements to ensure file operations
  complete before refresh, 4) Add refresh when webview appears/becomes visible
