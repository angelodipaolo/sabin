title: Fix warnings
description: Packaging vs code extension is outputting warnings.

I noticed some warnings when packaging the extension:

```
 WARNING  A 'repository' field is missing from the 'package.json' manifest file.
Use --allow-missing-repository to bypass.
Do you want to continue? [y/N] y
 WARNING  LICENSE, LICENSE.md, or LICENSE.txt not found
Do you want to continue? [y/N] y
 WARNING  This extension consists of 15528 files, out of which 97 are JavaScript files. For performance reasons, you should bundle your extension: https://aka.ms/vscode-bundle-extension. You should also exclude unnecessary files by adding them to your .vscodeignore: https://aka.ms/vscode-vscodeignore.

 WARNING  Neither a .vscodeignore file nor a "files" property in package.json was found. To ensure only necessary files are included in your extension, add a .vscodeignore file or specify the "files" property in package.json. More info: https://aka.ms/vscode-vscodeignore
 ```

 These may no longer be an issue since we made changes to how we package the extension but we should verify.

 You should:

 1. try to reproduce these warnings by packaging the extension
 2. if you can't reproduce them, ask user to test
 3. observe warnings and fix them
 4. ask user to verify warnings were fixed
